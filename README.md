# MyReads Project
This is Project 6 in Udacity's Front End Nano Degree/Grow With Google program.  The images below showcase the final look and functionality of the app.  Three sections (Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read) seperate the app into categories.  

Users can add and remove books to each category (also known as a shelf).  By clicking the green _'+'_ in the bottom right corner, the user can search for books (limited number of books, see below).

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
